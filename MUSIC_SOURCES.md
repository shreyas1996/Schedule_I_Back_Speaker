## Tips and Best Practices

### Local Music Files
1. **Organize your files**: Use clear, descriptive filenames
2. **Use MP3 format**: Best compatibility and performance
3. **Avoid very large files**: They may cause memory issues
4. **Check file permissions**: Ensure the mod can read your files

### YouTube Downloads
1. **Check video availability**: Some videos may be region-locked
2. **Respect copyright**: Only download content you have rights to use
3. **Monitor cache size**: Downloads are cached (max 50 files by default)
4. **Network requirements**: Downloads require stable internet connection

### General Usage
1. **Switch sources anytime**: You can change between sources without restarting
2. **Playlist integration**: All sources work with the existing playlist system
3. **Audio controls**: All standard controls (play, pause, volume, etc.) work with any source
4. **Headphone compatibility**: All sources work with the headphone attachment system

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Local Files Not Loading
- Check folder permissions
- Verify file formats are supported
- Try refreshing tracks
- Check log files for specific errors

#### YouTube Downloads Failing
- Check internet connection
- Verify URL format is correct
- Some videos may not be downloadable due to restrictions
- Try a different video URL

#### General Issues
- Check the mod logs for detailed error messages
- Try switching to a different music source
- Restart the BackSpeaker app if needed

### File Locations
- **Music Folder**: `[Game Directory]/Mods/BackSpeaker/Music/`
- **YouTube Cache**: `[Game Directory]/Mods/BackSpeaker/Cache/YouTube/`
- **Logs**: Check Unity console or mod logging system

## Developer Information

### Architecture
The music source system uses a provider pattern:
- `IMusicSourceProvider` interface for different sources
- `TrackLoader` manages providers and source switching
- `MusicSourceSelector` handles UI and user interaction

### YouTube Integration
- Uses **YoutubeExplode** library (pure C#, no external dependencies)
- Automatically extracts the best audio-only stream
- Supports MP4 and WebM containers
- Built-in caching system with automatic cleanup

### Adding New Sources
To add a new music source:
1. Implement `IMusicSourceProvider`
2. Register in `TrackLoader.InitializeMusicProviders()`
3. Add UI panel component
4. Update `MusicSourceSelector` button handling

### Configuration
Each provider supports configuration through the `GetConfiguration()` and `ApplyConfiguration()` methods. This allows for future customization options.

# Music Sources Documentation

This document explains how the Back Speaker Mod handles different music sources and audio loading.

## üéµ Audio Sources

### 1. Local Folder Music Provider

**Real Audio Playback with Embedded AudioImportLib**

The mod now includes AudioImportLib embedded as a resource, providing professional-grade audio decoding without requiring separate installations.

**How it works:**
- AudioImportLib.dll is embedded in the mod as a resource
- Loaded at runtime using reflection and Assembly.Load()
- Uses BASS audio library internally for robust format support
- Supports: MP3, WAV, OGG, FLAC, AIFF, WMA, M4A

**Technical Implementation:**
```csharp
// Embedded loading approach
EmbeddedAssemblyLoader.LoadAudioImportLib() // Load embedded DLL
AudioImportLib.API.LoadAudioClip(filePath, true) // via reflection
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Real audio decoding and playback
- ‚úÖ No dependency installation required  
- ‚úÖ Works in IL2CPP/MelonLoader environment
- ‚úÖ Wide format support via BASS library
- ‚úÖ Single-file distribution
